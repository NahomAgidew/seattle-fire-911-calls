# Seattle Fire Department 911 dispatches (GEOG 458 Final Assignment)

**Overview**

This project provides a map visualization of Seattle Fire Department 911 dispatches.
The map displays the location of the incident, the type of dispatch response, and the date & time of the call.

Since the whole dataset is big (over 500MB), I decided to narrow it down to calls made between January 1, 2021 and February 1, 2021. The goal of the project is to visually analyze where the most fire incidents had occurred in the Seattle area within the specified time period.
